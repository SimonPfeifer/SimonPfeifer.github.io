My name is Simon Pfeifer, I was born in the south of Germany and moved to the north of England when I was 12 years old. I studied Astrophysics and completed my PhD in 2020. Since then I have worked as a post-doctoral research scientist in Potsdam, Germany until 2024. My work largely focused on running computer simulations of the Universe to model the distribution and masses of galaxies in our "local" patch of space.

Ever since University I've had an interest in programming, which is what this website is dedicated to. I started out on MATLAB but quickly moved on to Python, probably due to its rising popularity at the time and it's prevalence in data analysis. Python really is a wonderful language to start with as its barrier for entry is relatively low and its plethora of packages enables you to do so many different things. My biggest inspiration, especially in the beginning, was Daniel Shiffman and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain" target="_blank">Coding Train</a> YouTube channel, which introduced me to <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> (a great way to sketch out code and draw things to the screen) and so many wonderful algorithms. Over time this developed into a passion for computer graphics and the intersection of code and art.

When I'm not busy doing the above, I like to play video games of all kinds. My mainstay here is Rocket League which I've been playing since 2016; peaked at around 1600 MMR. I also love to go hiking and camping, and drawing when I get the chance.
